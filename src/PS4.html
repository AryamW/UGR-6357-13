            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p class="div__p">The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has brought a new edge to the Cold War, 
                and in 1984, a one-eyed man with a prosthetic arm appears in the country. Those who 
                know him call him Snake; the legendary mercenary who was once swept from the stage of history and 
                left in a coma by American private intelligence network Cipher. Snake is accompanied by Ocelot, an old 
                friend who saved him from attack when he finally awoke.

                Now, Snake's former partner Kazuhira Miller is being held by the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. 
                Snake must undertake a solo mission to rescue Miller and prove to the world that the legendary mercenary 
                is not dead and gone. That first step will lead to a path of vengeance against the very Cipher that slaughtered 
                so many of Snake's men, and to a battle that will embroil the whole world...
                
                What started in Ground Zeroes must finish with "V".</p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p class="div__p">Set three years after the events of UNCHARTED 3: Drake's Deception, 
                Nathan Drake has presumably left the world of fortune-hunting behind. However, it doesn't 
                take long for fate to come calling when Drake's brother, Sam, resurfaces seeking his help to save his 
                own life and offering an adventure Drake can't resist.  

                On the hunt for Captain Henry Avery's long-lost treasure, 
                Sam and Drake set off to find Libertalia, the pirate utopia deep in the forests of Madagascar. 
                UNCHARTED 4: A Thief's End takes players on a journey around the globe, through jungle isles, far-flung cities 
                and snow-capped peaks on the search for Avery's fortune.</p>
